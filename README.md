## Usage
Open and run the project with Godot 4.

The default scene is `main.tscn`.

The ocean's shader parameters are controlled by the custom material `materials/visual_water_a.tres` utilized in scene `nodes/ocean.tscn`.

The camera and sound effects are setup in scene `nodes/game_camera.tscn`.

## Compatibility
This project is designed for Godot 4.

A Godot 3 version can be found in Platinguin's [original repository](https://github.com/Platinguin/Godot-Water-Shader-Prototype).
